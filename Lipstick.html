            <h2 id="heading1">How To Apply Lipstick Correctly?</h2>
            <p>
                <span id="apply">You think you slather your lipsticks on and it’s done. Well, ladies… Here's a secret, that’s a job half done. To apply your lipstick correctly and fabulously, allow us to give you some cues. Add these steps to your daily routine to transform your beauty game.</span>
            </p>
            <ol id="apply2">
                <li>Always begin by applying a lip balm. To achieve a glamourous pout you need to prepare a smooth base. A nourishing lip balm will not only make your lips soft, but it will also make sure your lipstick colour lasts all day long. And hey, who wants dry, chapped lips anyway?! </li>
                <li>Apply a concealer. If you worry about an uneven lip tone, give your lipstick colour a base to hang onto. Applying concealer to the lips will help your lipsticks deliver long-lasting colour.</li>
                <li>Always line your lips. This will help prevent your lipstick colour from bleeding. Lip liners will help you achieve a more defined pout. Trace over your natural lip line and that’s it! It is after this step that you should apply your lipstick.</li>
                <li>Always blot your lips once you’re done. Do this by gently squeezing lips together over a tissue. Blotting will keep your lipstick colour in place.</li>

            <p id="apply">Your lipsticks can be used in multiple ways, get set to save some bucks!</p>
            <ol id="apply2">
                <li>Use your lipstick as a blush- This will give you the same effect as given by a cream-based blush. Pick the right shade, dab a bit of the lipstick on your cheeks and blend it well with your fingers.</li>
                <li>Use your lipstick as a bronzer- A brown lipstick colour can easily be used as a bronzer. Use it like you would use a contour stick to make your face look sharp and sculpted.</li>
                <li>Use your lipstick as an eyeliner- Have your liquid lipsticks lying around in a corner? It’s time to try vibrant eye makeup looks, by using it as an eyeliner.</li>
                <li>Use your lipsticks as an eyeshadow- Using lipstick as an eyeshadow will help you achieve a look that’s super durable and smudge-proof. Note: Blend it well!</li>
                <li>Use your lipsticks as a concealer- A red lipstick colour can help you conceal dark circles. Apply it as a colour corrector before you perfect your base for face makeup. Voila! Your concealer to cover dark circles is now handy.</li>
