            <p><span>In our daily skincare routine, we wash our face once, twice or sometimes even thrice, why? So that we can keep our skin clean and dirt free. Face Wash is the first step in our skincare routine and we cannot take it lightly when it comes to the kind of face washes we choose for ourselves. A good face wash comes with minimum chemicals and harsh elements that not only do the job of cleansing but also nourishes and protects our skin thereafter. </span></p>
            <p><span>Many brands claim to have the best face wash in the market but you need to be smart in your selection when it comes to your “best face wash”. Be sure to pick a face wash as per your skin type. If you’re looking for a face wash for oily skin, then go for a face wash that has gel-based texture, and if you’re looking for a face wash for dry skin, then pick a moisturising face wash. And if you need a proper guide on face washes for different skin types and a list of our best-selling face washes then continue reading.</span></p>

                <p><span>If you are someone who has a lot of sebum secretion and finds your skin sticky and oily, you probably have oily skin. Hence, you need a face wash that suits your oily skin. Face wash made for oily skin has ingredients that can remove excess oil from your face and leave your skin with the required moisture to breathe and stay healthy. Most face wash for oily skin comes in a gel sort of texture, so pick the right face wash wisely!.</span></p>

                <p><span>People with dry skin always dread that using face wash will make their skin drier. But it’s absolutely wrong because if you use a face wash that suits other skin types and not dry skin, it will give you results accordingly. Therefore, it’s important to choose the right face wash for yourself. Face wash for dry skin is exactly made with elements that will leave your skin moist, nourished and will not let your skin get drier with its thick and moisturising formula.</span></p>

So if you have combination skin, you need to find the right face wash accordingly.</span></p>
